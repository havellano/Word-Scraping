<h1>Web-Scraping</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
As part of a recent project, we were tasked with the challenge of extracting informative paragraphs from a Wikipedia page on three distinct topics - Surtseyan, Submarine, and Subglacial Eruptions. In addition to this, we were required to use Regular Expressions (RegEx) to transform certain sentences in these extracted paragraphs. This exercise served as a valuable exercise in data extraction and manipulation, as well as providing an opportunity to hone our skills in text processing and analysis. Through this project, we were able to learn and apply various techniques to extract relevant information from a complex and dense source of text, helping us to develop important data science skills.
